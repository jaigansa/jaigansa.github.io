This project involved a complete overhaul of a Tata Ace mini-truck. We focused on structural integrity and payload efficiency.

### Key Features:
- **Reinforced Chassis**: Added extra support members for heavy-duty usage.
- **Custom Side Panels**: 1.2mm thick corrugated steel for maximum dent resistance.
- **Premium Finish**: Finished with anti-corrosion primer paint.
- **Ergonomic Tailgate**: Simplified locking mechanism for faster loading/unloading.
