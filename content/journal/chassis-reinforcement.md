Reinforcing a heavy-duty chassis isn't just about adding more steel; it's about understanding stress distribution. Today I finished a support member for a 14ft custom tipper. Using 5mm high-tensile plate, I've created a "box" reinforcement that doubles the torsional rigidity without adding excessive weight. 

Precision welding here is key—any micro-gap can lead to fatigue cracks under full load. #FabricationLife #MechanicalEngineering
