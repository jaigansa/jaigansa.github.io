Started the blueprints for the new BharatBenz sleeper bunk today. By modeling the cabin in 3D first, I can ensure every bolt hole aligns perfectly before we even touch the plasma cutter. This digital-first approach has reduced our material waste by nearly 15% this quarter.

Merging old-school fabrication with modern design tools is where the real innovation happens. #DigitalFabrication #SolidWorks
