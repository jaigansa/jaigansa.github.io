While ARC welding is great for heavy frames, TIG is my go-to for the finer details like cabin interiors and custom BBQ units. The control over heat input allows for cleaner beads and minimal distortion on thin sheets. 

Spent the morning practicing some vertical beads on stainless steel. It’s as much an art form as it is a trade. #TIGWelding #PrecisionMetalwork
