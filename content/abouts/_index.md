# Who Am I
I’m a welder with a big dream: to create something that lasts and leaves a mark on the world. While I take pride in my craft, I’m also passionate about the digital world—coding, exploring open-source projects, and streaming.

I love combining creativity with technology, always looking for new ways to grow and make an impact. My goal is to inspire others and leave a legacy that won’t be forgotten.
